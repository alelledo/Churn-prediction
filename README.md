# Churn prediction in the energy sector 

Customer data from a large Dutch energy supplier is analysed using R.
Data exploration and preparation are carried out and different predictive model are used: 
Logistic regression, Stepwise regression, Bagging and Boosting decision trees, Random forest and Support vector machines.
